# H&D Scheduling Optimizer INFORMS Project

We developed code made specifically for REMS, but it could easily be adopted by any organization for staff scheduling optimization. In addition, we made a GUI for ease of use to add the
scheduling form, and it will output a calendar with the assigned schedules, along with the ability to change shifts around. Finally, our program has the capability to send out Google Calendar invites.
